             PHYSICS ACCELERATION CALCULATOR - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
                    Master Newton's Second Law in JavaScript!
================================================================================

Welcome! This guide will teach you how to build a function that calculates 
acceleration using physics formulas. You'll be helping Isaac Newton bring physics 
to life in a video game!

Think of it this way: Ever wonder why a car with a bigger engine accelerates 
faster than a scooter? That's acceleration! In this assignment, you'll learn 
how to calculate it programmatically.

================================================================================
PART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE ASSIGNMENT
================================================================================

What You Need to Build:
------------------------
You need to create a function called `getAcceleration` that:
  • Takes an object with physical properties (force, mass, velocity, time, etc.)
  • Calculates the acceleration using one of THREE different physics formulas
  • Returns the acceleration value, OR
  • Returns the string "impossible" if there's not enough data

The function is like a flexible calculator - it can calculate acceleration in 
different ways depending on what information is available!

Real-World Example:
-------------------
Imagine Isaac Newton is creating a racing game. He has a car object:

Input Object:
{
  f: 10,        // force in Newtons
  m: 5,         // mass in kilograms
  Δv: 100,      // change in velocity
  Δt: 50,       // change in time
  t: 1,         // time
  d: 10         // distance
}

With this data, we can calculate acceleration in multiple ways:
  • Using force and mass: a = 10 / 5 = 2
  • Using velocity and time: a = 100 / 50 = 2
  • Using distance and time: a = (2 × 10) / 1² = 20

All three methods work! Your function needs to pick the best one available.

Why This Matters:
-----------------
This assignment teaches you several important programming skills:
  1. **Working with Objects** - You'll learn to read data from JavaScript objects
  2. **Conditional Logic** - You'll use if/else statements to check what data exists
  3. **Mathematical Operations** - You'll perform real physics calculations
  4. **Error Handling** - You'll decide what to do when data is missing
  5. **Problem Solving** - You'll figure out which formula to use based on available data

These are core programming concepts you'll use in every application you build!

================================================================================
PART 2: KEY CONCEPTS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
================================================================================

Concept 1: Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma)
--------------------------------------------------
Newton's Second Law states: "When forces acting on an object are unbalanced, 
the object will accelerate."

Think of pushing a shopping cart:
  • If you push harder (MORE FORCE) → it accelerates faster
  • If the cart is heavier (MORE MASS) → it accelerates slower with the same push

The formula is: a = F / m
  • a = acceleration (what we're calculating)
  • F = force applied
  • m = mass of the object

Real-world analogy: It's like dividing the effort (force) by the weight (mass) 
to see how much speedup you get!

Concept 2: Velocity and Time (Speed Changes)
---------------------------------------------
Velocity is how fast something is moving. When velocity changes, the object 
is accelerating!

Think about pressing the gas pedal in a car:
  • You go from 0 to 60 mph in 6 seconds
  • The change in speed is 60 mph
  • The time that passed is 6 seconds
  • The acceleration is: 60 / 6 = 10 mph per second

The formula is: a = Δv / Δt
  • Δv (delta v) = final velocity - initial velocity (the CHANGE)
  • Δt (delta t) = final time - initial time (the TIME IT TOOK)

Important: Δ means "change in" - it's how much something increased or decreased!

Concept 3: Distance Over Time (Motion Formula)
-----------------------------------------------
When you know how far something traveled and how long it took, you can also 
calculate acceleration!

Think about dropping a ball:
  • It falls 10 meters in 1 second
  • We can calculate how fast it's accelerating due to gravity

The formula is: a = 2d / t²
  • d = distance traveled
  • t = time elapsed
  • t² means time multiplied by itself (t × t)

This formula comes from physics, but you just need to know HOW to use it!

Concept 4: JavaScript Objects and Properties
----------------------------------------------
Objects in JavaScript are like containers that hold related information.

Example:
  const car = {
    f: 10,        // property: f
    m: 5,         // property: m
    Δv: 100       // property: Δv
  };

To access properties:
  car.f returns 10
  car.m returns 5
  car.Δv returns 100

We check if a property exists by using conditions like:
  if (obj.f !== undefined) { ... } // Check if 'f' exists

Concept 5: Choosing the Right Formula
--------------------------------------
Here's the key insight: You have THREE formulas, but they all need specific data!

Formula 1 (a = F/m):
  • Needs: force (f) AND mass (m)
  • Both must exist and be valid

Formula 2 (a = Δv/Δt):
  • Needs: velocity change (Δv) AND time change (Δt)
  • Both must exist and be valid

Formula 3 (a = 2d/t²):
  • Needs: distance (d) AND time (t)
  • Both must exist and be valid
  • t cannot be 0 (you can't divide by 0!)

Your function checks in order: Does this formula work? No? Try the next one!

================================================================================
PART 3: STEP-BY-STEP ALGORITHM (Your Thinking Process)
================================================================================

Step 1: Take in the object with physical properties
     Your function receives an object like {f: 10, m: 5, ...}

Step 2: Check if we can use Formula 1 (F/m)
     Ask: "Do we have both 'f' and 'm' properties?"
     Ask: "Are they both valid numbers (not 0, not undefined)?"
     If yes: Calculate a = f / m and return it
     If no: Continue to next formula

Step 3: Check if we can use Formula 2 (Δv/Δt)
     Ask: "Do we have both 'Δv' and 'Δt' properties?"
     Ask: "Are they both valid numbers?"
     If yes: Calculate a = Δv / Δt and return it
     If no: Continue to next formula

Step 4: Check if we can use Formula 3 (2d/t²)
     Ask: "Do we have both 'd' and 't' properties?"
     Ask: "Is 't' not equal to 0?" (can't divide by 0!)
     If yes: Calculate a = (2 * d) / (t * t) and return it
     If no: Continue to next step

Step 5: No formula worked - return "impossible"
     If we reach here, we don't have enough valid data
     Return the string "impossible"

================================================================================
PART 4: THE COMPLETE SOLUTION WITH COMMENTS
================================================================================

Here's a working solution with detailed comments explaining each part:

```javascript
function getAcceleration(obj) {
  // Try Formula 1: a = F / m (Force divided by Mass)
  // This works if we have both force (f) and mass (m)
  if (obj.f !== undefined && obj.m !== undefined) {
    // We have the data we need
    return obj.f / obj.m;
  }
  
  // Try Formula 2: a = Δv / Δt (Velocity change divided by Time change)
  // This works if we have both change in velocity and change in time
  if (obj.Δv !== undefined && obj.Δt !== undefined) {
    // We have the data we need
    return obj.Δv / obj.Δt;
  }
  
  // Try Formula 3: a = 2d / t² (2 times distance divided by time squared)
  // This works if we have both distance (d) and time (t)
  // BUT: time cannot be 0, otherwise we'd divide by zero (impossible!)
  if (obj.d !== undefined && obj.t !== undefined && obj.t !== 0) {
    // Calculate: 2 * distance / (time * time)
    return (2 * obj.d) / (obj.t * obj.t);
  }
  
  // If none of the formulas worked, we don't have enough data
  return "impossible";
}
```

Example Usage:
--------------
Let's test this function with real examples:

Example 1 - Using Force and Mass:
  const car = { f: 10, m: 5 };
  getAcceleration(car);  // Returns: 2
  // Because 10 / 5 = 2

Example 2 - Using Velocity and Time Changes:
  const runner = { Δv: 100, Δt: 50 };
  getAcceleration(runner);  // Returns: 2
  // Because 100 / 50 = 2

Example 3 - Using Distance and Time:
  const ball = { d: 10, t: 1 };
  getAcceleration(ball);  // Returns: 20
  // Because (2 * 10) / (1 * 1) = 20 / 1 = 20

Example 4 - Not Enough Data:
  const incomplete = { f: 10 };  // Only has force, no mass!
  getAcceleration(incomplete);  // Returns: "impossible"
  // Because we need both f AND m for Formula 1
  // And we don't have the data for Formulas 2 or 3

Example 5 - Multiple Properties (Uses First Valid Formula):
  const fullData = { f: 10, m: 5, Δv: 100, Δt: 50 };
  getAcceleration(fullData);  // Returns: 2
  // Because Formula 1 works first (f and m exist)
  // It uses that and doesn't check the others

================================================================================
PART 5: UNDERSTANDING THE MATH/LOGIC DEEPER
================================================================================

Let's trace through a complete example step by step:

Scenario: A rocket with the following properties:
  const rocket = {
    f: 1000,    // Force: 1000 Newtons
    m: 100,     // Mass: 100 kilograms
    Δv: 200,    // Velocity change: 200 m/s
    Δt: 20,     // Time change: 20 seconds
    d: 50,      // Distance: 50 meters
    t: 2        // Time: 2 seconds
  };

Step-by-Step Execution:

Step 1: Function receives the rocket object
  getAcceleration(rocket)

Step 2: Check Formula 1 (a = F/m)
  Check: Does rocket.f exist? YES (1000)
  Check: Does rocket.m exist? YES (100)
  Condition is TRUE! We can use this formula
  Calculate: 1000 / 100 = 10
  RETURN 10 immediately (we don't check other formulas)

Why We Stop Here:
  Our function returns as soon as it finds a working formula. This is efficient
  and mirrors real-world physics - if you know force and mass, you use that
  method immediately!

Alternative: What If We Didn't Have Force?
  const rocket2 = { m: 100, Δv: 200, Δt: 20, d: 50, t: 2 };
  
  Step 1: Check Formula 1 - rocket2.f is undefined, so skip
  Step 2: Check Formula 2 - rocket2.Δv exists (200) AND rocket2.Δt exists (20)
  Calculate: 200 / 20 = 10
  RETURN 10

Why Different Data Can Give Same Answers:
  All three formulas should give the same acceleration when describing the same
  motion! This is because they're all just different ways of expressing
  Newton's Second Law. Physics is consistent!

Edge Case: Dividing by Zero
  const bad = { d: 50, t: 0 };  // Time is 0!
  
  Step 1: Check Formula 1 - missing f and m, skip
  Step 2: Check Formula 2 - missing Δv and Δt, skip
  Step 3: Check Formula 3 - has d (50) and t (0)
          BUT: Check if t !== 0? NO! t IS 0!
          Condition is FALSE, skip this too
  Step 4: No formula worked
  RETURN "impossible"
  
  We specifically check for t !== 0 to avoid the math error of dividing by zero!

  • See immediate feedback
  • Experiment with different inputs
  • Understand which formula is being used

================================================================================
PART 8: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
================================================================================

❌ Mistake 1: Using 'undefined' Comparison Wrong
   Problem: Writing `if (obj.f)` instead of `if (obj.f !== undefined)`
   Why it's wrong: If f is 0 (a valid value), the condition is false!
   Solution: Always use `if (obj.f !== undefined)` to properly check existence

❌ Mistake 2: Forgetting to Check for Zero Division
   Problem: Not checking if obj.t !== 0 before using Formula 3
   Why it's wrong: Dividing by 0 causes errors and incorrect results
   Solution: Always include `&& obj.t !== 0` in the Formula 3 condition

❌ Mistake 3: Checking Formulas in Wrong Order
   Problem: Not stopping after finding a valid formula
   Why it's wrong: Your function might try multiple formulas when one already worked
   Solution: Use `return` immediately when a formula works (this stops the function)

❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting to Return the String "impossible"
   Problem: Returning null, undefined, or false instead of the string
   Why it's wrong: The test expects the exact string "impossible"
   Solution: Always return the exact string: return "impossible"

❌ Mistake 5: Confusing the Greek Delta Symbol (Δ)
   Problem: Writing 'DeltaV' or 'dv' instead of 'Δv'
   Why it's wrong: JavaScript is case-sensitive; property names must match exactly
   Solution: Copy the exact property names from the assignment (use copy-paste!)

================================================================================
PART 9: BONUS CHALLENGES
================================================================================

Once you've finished the basic assignment, try these exciting extensions:

Challenge 1: Input Validation
   Description: Enhance your function to check if inputs are positive numbers
   Try This: If any required value is negative (like negative mass?), return "impossible"
   Why it matters: Real physics data should never have negative mass!
   Hint: Add conditions like `&& obj.m > 0`

Challenge 2: Create a Calculation Logger
   Description: Before returning, log which formula was used
   Try This: Create a version that returns an object: { acceleration: 2, formula: 'F/m' }
   Why it matters: This helps debug and understand which method was chosen
   Example return: { acceleration: 10, formula: 'Δv/Δt' }

Challenge 3: Rounding Results
   Description: Round acceleration to 2 decimal places
   Try This: Learn about Math.round() and toFixed() methods
   Why it matters: Real measurements often need practical precision
   Example: 33.333333 becomes 33.33

Challenge 4: Calculate Multiple Properties
   Description: Create a function that calculates OTHER physics properties
   Try This: Write a function that calculates force, mass, or velocity from acceleration
   Why it matters: Physics is bidirectional - you can solve for any variable!
   Formula: f = m * a (Force = Mass × Acceleration)

Challenge 5: Physics Simulator
   Description: Create a simple animation that updates position based on acceleration
   Try This: Use acceleration to update an object's position over time
   Why it matters: This is how video games and physics engines work!
   Concept: If you know acceleration, you can predict future position

Challenge 6: Unit Conversion
   Description: Handle different units (m/s, km/h, etc.)
   Try This: Create functions that convert between unit systems
   Why it matters: Real-world applications use many different units
   Example: Convert mph to m/s before calculating

Challenge 7: Error Messages
   Description: Instead of "impossible", explain WHY it's impossible
   Try This: Return a detailed message like "Missing: force and mass"
   Why it matters: Better error messages help debug faster
   Example: "impossible - need either (f AND m) OR (Δv AND Δt) OR (d AND t>0)"

================================================================================
PART 10: FINAL THOUGHTS
================================================================================

This assignment teaches several important programming concepts:

1. **Object Property Access** - Reading data from JavaScript objects, checking
   if properties exist. This is fundamental to working with real data!

2. **Conditional Logic (if/else)** - Making decisions based on available data.
   Every program needs to make choices about what to do based on circumstances.

3. **Mathematical Operations** - Applying formulas to calculate results. Programming
   is often about translating math into code!

4. **Edge Case Handling** - Thinking about what happens when data is missing or
   invalid (like dividing by zero). Professional programmers always anticipate problems.

5. **Formula Selection** - Choosing between different approaches based on available
   information. This teaches flexibility and problem-solving!

6. **Return Values** - Functions returning different types (numbers AND strings).
   Understanding what your function should return is crucial!

7. **Physics Thinking** - Understanding that the same physical principle (Newton's
   Second Law) can be expressed multiple ways mathematically!

These skills are fundamental to all programming. Once you understand:
  • How to work with objects
  • How to use conditional logic
  • How to perform calculations
  
You can build much more complex applications!

Remember: Every expert programmer you've ever heard of started exactly where you
are now - learning to solve problems with code. The fact that you're working
through physics problems means you're building real problem-solving skills that
companies like Google, Microsoft, and NASA use every single day!

Programming is like learning to write in a new language. At first, it's confusing,
but with practice, it becomes natural. Keep exploring, keep experimenting, and
most importantly - keep building things! The best programmers learn by DOING.

The physics you're coding isn't just academic - it's powering video games,
designing safer cars, launching rockets, and analyzing everything from sports
to weather patterns. You're literally writing code that could change the world!

================================================================================
PART 11: COMPLETE CORRECT SOLUTION
================================================================================

Below is the final, clean version of the solution that you should submit:

```javascript
function getAcceleration(obj) {
  // Formula 1: a = F / m (Force divided by Mass)
  if (obj.f !== undefined && obj.m !== undefined) {
    return obj.f / obj.m;
  }
  
  // Formula 2: a = Δv / Δt (Change in velocity divided by change in time)
  if (obj.Δv !== undefined && obj.Δt !== undefined) {
    return obj.Δv / obj.Δt;
  }
  
  // Formula 3: a = 2d / t² (2 times distance divided by time squared)
  if (obj.d !== undefined && obj.t !== undefined && obj.t !== 0) {
    return (2 * obj.d) / (obj.t * obj.t);
  }
  
  // No valid formula could be applied
  return "impossible";
}
```

Verification of Correct Output:
-------------------------------
Test your function with these cases. If you get these exact results, you've 
solved it correctly!

Test Case 1:
  Input: { f: 10, m: 5 }
  Output: 2
  Calculation: 10 / 5 = 2

Test Case 2:
  Input: { Δv: 100, Δt: 50 }
  Output: 2
  Calculation: 100 / 50 = 2

Test Case 3:
  Input: { d: 10, t: 1 }
  Output: 20
  Calculation: (2 × 10) / (1 × 1) = 20

Test Case 4:
  Input: { f: 10 }
  Output: "impossible"
  Reason: Need mass to use first formula; don't have data for other formulas

Test Case 5:
  Input: { f: 20, m: 4, Δv: 50, Δt: 10 }
  Output: 5
  Calculation: Uses first formula: 20 / 4 = 5

Test Case 6:
  Input: { d: 50, t: 0 }
  Output: "impossible"
  Reason: Can't divide by 0 in the formula 2d/t²

Test Case 7:
  Input: {}
  Output: "impossible"
  Reason: No data provided

Why This Solution Works:
------------------------
✓ Checks all three formulas in logical order
✓ Returns immediately when a formula works (efficient!)
✓ Includes safety check for division by zero (t !== 0)
✓ Properly checks for undefined properties
✓ Returns the exact string "impossible" when no formula can be used
✓ Handles all edge cases (empty objects, partial data, etc.)
✓ Uses clear, readable code with good naming
✓ Implements Newton's Second Law correctly
✓ Can handle any valid combination of input properties
✓ Follows best practices for conditional logic

  • A summary showing how many passed

Step 5: Debug If Needed
  If any tests fail, check your function code
  Make changes and refresh the browser (F5) to test again

Troubleshooting:
----------------

Problem: "getAcceleration is not defined"
Solution: Make sure you pasted the entire function into the console. Copy the
          complete function from PART 11, including the opening "function" and
          closing "}"

Problem: "Syntax Error"
Solution: Check that you pasted the code correctly. The delta symbol Δ might
          have gotten corrupted. Copy from the guide again or retype it carefully.

Problem: Function returns "impossible" but should return a number
Solution: Check if all required properties exist:
          - For Formula 1, you need BOTH f AND m
          - For Formula 2, you need BOTH Δv AND Δt
          - For Formula 3, you need BOTH d AND t (and t must not be 0)

Problem: The HTML test file shows all red X marks
Solution: Your function might have a logic error. Review the conditions in each
          if statement. Make sure you're checking the exact property names and
          using !== instead of ==.

Problem: "Can't find the delta symbol (Δ)"
Solution: The delta symbol is the Greek letter Δ. When copying from this guide,
          it should copy correctly. If having issues, type it or use copy-paste
          from the code examples.
