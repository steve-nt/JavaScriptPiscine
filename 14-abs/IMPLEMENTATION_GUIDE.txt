                    ABS: ABSOLUTE VALUE FUNCTIONS - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
                Understanding Positive Numbers and Absolute Values
================================================================================

Welcome! This guide will teach you how to build two essential functions that work
with numbers: determining if a number is positive, and finding its absolute value.

Think of it this way: absolute value is like measuring the distance from your
front door to anywhere in your neighborhood. Whether you go left or right, 
forward or backward, the DISTANCE is always positive. The abs() function does 
exactly this - it tells you the "distance" a number is from zero!

================================================================================
PART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE ASSIGNMENT
================================================================================

What You Need to Build:
------------------------
1. A function called isPositive() that:
   - Takes a number as input
   - Returns TRUE if the number is strictly greater than 0
   - Returns FALSE for zero or any negative number

2. A function called abs() that:
   - Takes a number as input
   - Returns the absolute value (the positive version of the number)
   - If the number is already positive, return it unchanged
   - If the number is negative, remove the minus sign and return the positive
   - You CANNOT use JavaScript's built-in Math.abs() function

Real-World Example:
-------------------
Imagine you're tracking your money in a bank account:

   isPositive(500)   → true  (You have money, that's positive!)
   isPositive(-50)   → false (You're short, that's not positive)
   isPositive(0)     → false (You have nothing, not positive)

   abs(500)          → 500   (You have 500, distance from 0 is 500)
   abs(-50)          → 50    (You're short 50, but distance from 0 is still 50)
   abs(0)            → 0     (Zero distance is zero)

Why This Matters:
-----------------
These functions teach you about:
- Making decisions in code (the ternary operator)
- Understanding positive and negative numbers
- Writing functions that check conditions
- Creating your own implementations instead of relying on built-in tools

This is real programming! Many features you use every day require these concepts.

================================================================================
PART 2: KEY CONCEPTS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
================================================================================

Concept 1: Understanding Positive Numbers
------------------------------------------
A positive number is any number GREATER THAN zero.
Zero (0) is NOT positive. Negative numbers are NOT positive.

Think of it like this: Your score in a video game.
- 100 points = positive (you're winning!)
- 0 points = neutral (you haven't scored)
- -10 points = negative (you lost points)

To check if a number is positive, we simply ask: "Is it > 0?"

Concept 2: Understanding Absolute Value
----------------------------------------
The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on a number line.
Distance is always positive (or zero), never negative.

Visual representation:
     -5    -4    -3    -2    -1     0     1     2     3     4     5
     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
     └─────────────────┘                      └──────────────────┘
         5 units away                              5 units away

abs(-5) = 5 (same distance as abs(5) = 5)

Think of it like this: If you're 5 miles west OR 5 miles east, you're still
5 miles away from your home. The direction doesn't matter for distance.

Concept 3: The Ternary Operator (Conditional Expression)
---------------------------------------------------------
The ternary operator is a SHORT way to write an if-else statement in one line.

Normal if-else:
   if (condition) {
       value = true_value;
   } else {
       value = false_value;
   }

Ternary operator:
   value = condition ? true_value : false_value;

Think of it like a question:
   "Is the condition true?" ? "Do this" : "Do that"

Example:
   let age = 16;
   let status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Teen";
   // status now equals "Teen" because 16 is NOT >= 18

For our assignment:
   isPositive(5)  = 5 > 0 ? true : false  →  5 > 0 is TRUE, so returns true
   isPositive(-3) = -3 > 0 ? true : false  → -3 > 0 is FALSE, so returns false

Concept 4: Functions and Return Values
--------------------------------------
A function is a reusable block of code that:
1. Takes input (parameters)
2. Does something with that input
3. Returns a result back to the caller

function functionName(parameter) {
    // Do something with the parameter
    return result;  // Send the result back
}

When you call the function, whatever you "return" is what the function produces.

   let result = isPositive(5);  // result becomes true
   let distance = abs(-7);      // distance becomes 7

================================================================================
PART 3: STEP-BY-STEP ALGORITHM (Your Thinking Process)
================================================================================

FOR THE isPositive() FUNCTION:
Step 1: Accept a number as a parameter
Step 2: Check if the number is greater than 0
Step 3: Return true if it is, false if it isn't
Step 4: Use the ternary operator to do this in one line

FOR THE abs() FUNCTION:
Step 1: Accept a number as a parameter
Step 2: Check if the number is positive (>= 0)
Step 3: If it's positive or zero, return it unchanged
Step 4: If it's negative, multiply it by -1 to make it positive
Step 5: Use the ternary operator to do this in one line

================================================================================
PART 4: THE COMPLETE SOLUTION WITH COMMENTS
================================================================================

// Function 1: Check if a number is strictly positive
function isPositive(number) {
    // The ternary operator: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
    // We ask: "Is number greater than 0?"
    // If YES: return true
    // If NO: return false
    return number > 0 ? true : false;
}

// Function 2: Return the absolute value (distance from zero)
function abs(number) {
    // If the number is greater than or equal to 0, it's already positive
    // So we return it unchanged
    // If the number is negative, we multiply by -1 to flip the sign
    // Examples:
    //   number = 5  →  5 >= 0 is true  →  return 5
    //   number = -5 →  -5 >= 0 is false → return -5 * -1 = 5
    //   number = 0  →  0 >= 0 is true  →  return 0
    return number >= 0 ? number : number * -1;
}

Example Usage:
--------------

// Testing isPositive()
console.log(isPositive(5));      // Output: true  (5 > 0)
console.log(isPositive(-3));     // Output: false (-3 is not > 0)
console.log(isPositive(0));      // Output: false (0 is not > 0)
console.log(isPositive(100));    // Output: true  (100 > 0)
console.log(isPositive(-0.5));   // Output: false (-0.5 < 0)

// Testing abs()
console.log(abs(5));             // Output: 5    (5 is already positive)
console.log(abs(-5));            // Output: 5    (opposite of -5)
console.log(abs(0));             // Output: 0    (0 has no sign)
console.log(abs(-100));          // Output: 100  (opposite of -100)
console.log(abs(-3.5));          // Output: 3.5  (opposite of -3.5)

What the outputs mean:
- isPositive() returns true/false (a boolean) - tells you if it's positive
- abs() returns a number - tells you the "magnitude" or "distance from zero"

================================================================================
PART 5: UNDERSTANDING THE MATH/LOGIC DEEPER
================================================================================

Let's trace through the abs() function with actual numbers:

EXAMPLE 1: abs(7)
   Step 1: Parameter number = 7
   Step 2: Check: is 7 >= 0? YES!
   Step 3: Return 7 unchanged
   Step 4: Result: 7
   Logic: The number is already positive, so don't change it.

EXAMPLE 2: abs(-7)
   Step 1: Parameter number = -7
   Step 2: Check: is -7 >= 0? NO!
   Step 3: We go to the false case: return -7 * -1
   Step 4: Calculation: -7 * -1 = 7  (negative times negative equals positive)
   Step 5: Result: 7
   Logic: The number is negative, so we flip its sign to make it positive.

EXAMPLE 3: abs(0)
   Step 1: Parameter number = 0
   Step 2: Check: is 0 >= 0? YES!
   Step 3: Return 0 unchanged
   Step 4: Result: 0
   Logic: Zero is neither positive nor negative. It stays zero.

Why the formula works for negative numbers:
When a number is negative (like -7), multiplying it by -1 flips the sign:
   -7 × -1 = 7

This is because:
- A negative number represents a debt or distance in the opposite direction
- Flipping the sign (multiplying by -1) converts it to the positive equivalent

Alternative approach (not used here, but good to know):
You could also write: return number >= 0 ? number : -number;
This does the same thing! Instead of "* -1", we use "-number" (the negation operator).

================================================================================
PART 7: TESTING YOUR CODE IN A BROWSER
================================================================================

Method 1: Using the Browser Console (Easiest)
----------------------------------------------
The browser console is like a JavaScript calculator built into your browser!

Steps:
1. Open any website in your browser (or a blank HTML file)
2. Press F12 (or right-click → Inspect → Console tab)
3. Copy-paste your functions into the console
4. Press Enter to define them
5. Now test them by typing function calls:
   
   isPositive(5)
   isPositive(-3)
   abs(-10)
   abs(42)

Test Cases to Try:
   isPositive(1)          → should be true
   isPositive(0)          → should be false
   isPositive(-1)         → should be false
   isPositive(999)        → should be true
   isPositive(-999)       → should be false
   
   abs(1)                 → should be 1
   abs(-1)                → should be 1
   abs(0)                 → should be 0
   abs(42)                → should be 42
   abs(-42)               → should be 42
   abs(-3.5)              → should be 3.5

Method 2: Create an HTML File (More Professional)
---------------------------------------------------
This creates a proper test environment that you can save and reuse.

Steps:
1. Create a new file called "test-abs.html"
2. Copy the HTML code below
3. Save it
4. Open it in your browser
5. Check the browser console (F12) to see test results

See PART 12 below for the complete HTML template.

Method 3: Interactive Browser Testing (Advanced)
-------------------------------------------------
Once you're comfortable, you can create an interactive page with buttons and
text inputs that let you test the functions by typing values and seeing results
in real-time. This requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.

================================================================================
PART 8: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
================================================================================

❌ Mistake 1: Using Math.abs() directly
   Problem: The assignment says "You must not use Math.abs()"
   Solution: Write your own implementation using the ternary operator

❌ Mistake 2: Forgetting to return a value
   Problem: Your function does something but doesn't return the result
   Example: function abs(n) { n >= 0 ? n : -n; }  ← Missing "return"!
   Solution: Always use the return keyword: return n >= 0 ? n : -n;

❌ Mistake 3: Using = instead of == or ===
   Problem: Checking a condition with the assignment operator (=) instead of comparison (==)
   Example: if (number = 0) - This ASSIGNS 0, doesn't check!
   Solution: Use == or === for comparisons: if (number === 0)

❌ Mistake 4: Not understanding the ternary operator syntax
   Problem: Putting the values in wrong order or wrong punctuation
   Example: return 5 > 0 ? false : true;  ← This returns backwards!
   Solution: Remember: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

❌ Mistake 5: Testing with Math.abs() to check your work
   Problem: If you use Math.abs() to verify, you won't know if YOUR function works!
   Solution: Test by manually calculating what the answer should be first

================================================================================
PART 9: BONUS CHALLENGES
================================================================================

Once you've finished the basic assignment, try these to deepen your skills:

Challenge 1: Create an isNegative() function
   Description: Similar to isPositive(), but returns true if the number is 
   strictly negative (less than 0). Use the same ternary operator pattern!

Challenge 2: Create a compareMagnitude() function
   Description: Takes two numbers and returns which one has the larger 
   absolute value. Example: compareMagnitude(-10, 3) → -10 (because 10 > 3)

Challenge 3: Create a getSign() function
   Description: Takes a number and returns:
   - 1 if the number is positive
   - 0 if the number is zero
   - -1 if the number is negative

Challenge 4: Create a distance() function
   Description: Takes two numbers and returns how far apart they are.
   Example: distance(3, 7) → 4, distance(-2, 5) → 7
   Hint: You can use your abs() function to help!

Challenge 5: Create a round() function
   Description: Takes a number and rounds it to the nearest integer.
   Hint: This is trickier! Research Math.floor() and Math.ceil() for hints.
   Don't use Math.round(), make your own!

================================================================================
PART 10: FINAL THOUGHTS
================================================================================

This assignment teaches several important programming concepts:

1. **Function Design** - How to write functions that solve specific problems
2. **Conditional Logic** - Making decisions in code using conditions
3. **The Ternary Operator** - A concise way to write if-else statements
4. **Understanding Numbers** - Working with positive, negative, and zero values
5. **Math Foundations** - Understanding absolute value and distance concepts

These skills are fundamental to ALL programming. Once you understand these 
concepts, you can build much more complex applications! You're not just learning
syntax; you're learning how to think like a programmer.

Remember: Every professional programmer started exactly where you are. Don't be 
afraid to experiment, test your code frequently, and ask questions. Making 
mistakes is how you learn!

Your journey into JavaScript is just beginning. These simple functions are the 
building blocks for:
- Data validation (checking if inputs are valid)
- Game development (calculating distances)
- Financial applications (working with positive/negative balances)
- Scientific calculations (working with measurements)
- And SO much more!

================================================================================
PART 11: COMPLETE CORRECT SOLUTION
================================================================================

Below is the final, clean version of the solution that you should submit:

```javascript
function isPositive(number) {
    return number > 0 ? true : false;
}

function abs(number) {
    return number >= 0 ? number : number * -1;
}
```

SHORTER VERSION (More Professional):
You can also write it more concisely:

```javascript
function isPositive(number) {
    return number > 0;  // This already returns true or false, no ternary needed
}

function abs(number) {
    return number >= 0 ? number : -number;  // Using -number instead of number * -1
}
```

Verification of Correct Output:
--------------------------------

Test the functions with these inputs and verify the outputs:

isPositive Tests:
   isPositive(10)    → true
   isPositive(-5)    → false
   isPositive(0)     → false
   isPositive(0.1)   → true
   isPositive(-0.1)  → false

abs Tests:
   abs(10)           → 10
   abs(-10)          → 10
   abs(0)            → 0
   abs(-3.14)        → 3.14
   abs(3.14)         → 3.14

If your function returns these exact values, you've solved it correctly!

Why This Solution Works:
------------------------
✓ isPositive() correctly identifies strictly positive numbers (> 0)
✓ isPositive() correctly rejects zero and negative numbers
✓ abs() correctly returns positive numbers unchanged
✓ abs() correctly converts negative numbers to positive by flipping their sign
✓ abs() doesn't use Math.abs(), fulfilling the "no built-in" requirement
✓ Both functions use clear, readable code that follows JavaScript conventions
✓ The ternary operator makes the code concise and elegant

How to Use the HTML Test File:
1. Copy the HTML code above into a text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++)
2. Save it as "test-abs.html" on your computer
3. Open the file in your web browser (double-click it)
4. You'll see test results displayed on the page
5. Click "Run All Tests" button to run the tests again anytime

Troubleshooting:
----------------

Problem: The page shows "ReferenceError: isPositive is not defined"
Solution: Make sure you pasted the function definitions correctly. Check that
the code is properly indented and there are no typos.

Problem: All tests show as FAIL (red background)
Solution: Check your function logic. Make sure:
   - isPositive() returns true only for numbers > 0
   - abs() returns the correct absolute value
   - You're not using Math.abs()

Problem: The HTML file won't open in my browser
Solution: Try one of these:
   - Right-click the file → Open With → Choose your browser
   - Drag and drop the file into an open browser window
   - Type the file path into the address bar (with file:// at the start)
